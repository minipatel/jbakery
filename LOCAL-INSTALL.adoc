= Local install for development


== Testing install

One way to test Jbakery locally is to install it and use it to test the features.

This setup ensures we can update versions easily. It requires `symbolic link` support. 

Add the `JBAKERY_HOME` environemnt variable to your `~/.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

[source, shell]
----
  export JBAKERY_HOME=~/local/programe/jbakery
  export PATH=$PATH:$JBAKERY_HOME/bin
----

NOTE: You will need to start another terminal whenever you change versions so the `$PATH` is updated and `jbakery` will be found.

Then use gradel to build and install the project locally

----
  ./gradlew localInstall
----

And make sure you link the development build directory to your local testing directory.

[source, shell]
----
  rm ~/local/programe/jbakery
  ln -s /home/ieugen/contracte/netdava.com/jbakery/jbakery-0.0.5-SNAPSHOT ~/local/programe/jbakery
  echo "Restart your terminal (or source the shell config) and enjoy"
  jbakery
